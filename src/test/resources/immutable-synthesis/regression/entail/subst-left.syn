should be able to substitute equalities
TODO would using immutable here belie too much knowledge on operator's part?
###
{ 5 == z  /\  y == a ; [x :-> y]@I@a ** y :-> z}
void foo (loc x, loc y)
{ x == x  /\  a == y  /\  true ; [x :-> y]@I@a ** y :-> 5}
###
void foo (loc x, loc y) {
}

lmao using immutable fixes the problem with recognizing inequality
